# Clean-Space
Clean Space is an AI that detects the type of germs on your hands and how severe they can be to your health.

Inspiration

I remember eating at a restaurant and wondering how many people actually clean their hands properly before handling food. I then thought it would be cool to regulate who washes their hands frequently. With the help of AI and useful web sources we could make the world a cleaner place.

Where Could You Find Clean Space?

Clean Space could be found in restuarants, airports, homes, schools etc.

Why Wash Your Hands?
--- 
According to *Centers For Disease Control and Prevention*, Feces (poop) from people or animals is an important source of germs like Salmonella, E. coli O157, and norovirus that cause diarrhea, and it can spread some respiratory infections like adenovirus and hand-foot-mouth disease. These kinds of germs can get onto hands after people use the toilet or change a diaper, but also in less obvious ways, like after handling raw meats that have invisible amounts of animal poop on them. A single gram of human feces—which is about the weight of a paper clip—can contain one trillion germs. Germs can also get onto hands if people touch any object that has germs on it because someone coughed or sneezed on it or was touched by some other contaminated object. When these germs get onto hands and are not washed off, they can be passed from person to person and make people sick.
